This is OpenWrt convenience feed for hnet-core and all it's dependencies.

Simple usage:

- add following line to feeds.conf

src-git hnet git://github.com/fingon/hnet-openwrt-openwrt-feed.git

# scripts/feeds update
# scripts/feeds install hnet
# make oldconfig
(and select things, or make menuconfig + choose 'hnet' under IPv6)

.. make new image, and configure to your's heart's content

NOTE: By default, the current version has several downsides:

* firewall is disabled
* you cannot choose (using some elegant way, at any rate) the active interfaces

and therefore it's disabled even if built into the image. That caveat said..

- to run after flashing the router, run

  /etc/init.d/hnet start

(to test it once), or 

  /etc/init.d/hnet enable

to enable it every boot.
