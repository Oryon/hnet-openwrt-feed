This is OpenWrt convenience feed for hnet-core and all it's dependencies.

Simple usage:

- add following line to feeds.conf

src-git hnet git://github.com/fingon/hnet-openwrt-openwrt-feed.git

# scripts/feeds update
# scripts/feeds install hnet
# make oldconfig
(and select things, or make menuconfig + choose 'hnet' under IPv6)

.. make new image, and configure to your's heart's content

(TODO - sample configuration feed package coming 'soon')
